# Scala JSON

This is just something I built while getting the hang of scala, definitely should not be used by anyone.

Currently this was just a way for me to have dynamic JSON Objects (I know, kind of defeats the point of using scala ay?) within scala that I could easily print out to actual json.

## Usage

This hinges around the `JSONObject` class which you can provide a list key value pairs in a touple. The `JSONObject` class will handle the values to ensure they are printed correctly for their type.
